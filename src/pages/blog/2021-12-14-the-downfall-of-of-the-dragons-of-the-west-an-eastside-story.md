It was another autumn day in Ontario. Nithiyan, Zain, and Roy are in the middle of a canoe trip in Killarney. Nithiyan bursts out with "Guys I think we should form a club, called '**Dragons of the West**!'"

*Roy and Zain paused for a minute.*

They said, "Aren't we on the east coast?" Nithiyan thought for a minute. His eyes lit up again and said "No it's because we are on the west side of the world."

Nithiyan's friends shook their heads and continued paddling across the lake. A few minutes went by and suddenly the boys hear this intense swoop from above. It turns out it was the gang from the Dragons from the East club! 

Their dragon was 10 meters of glory with its scales reflecting the sun at Nithiyans face which made it hard to see what was above him. The dragon took a deep ominous breath in and destroyed the canoe with no effort. 

There was such a mess that it looked clear that no one could survive that. However, one person pulls all three to safety. And it turns out it was their friend Trang!
